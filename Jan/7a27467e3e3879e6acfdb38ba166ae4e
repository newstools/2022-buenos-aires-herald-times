Argentina's Economy Minister Martín Guzmán and Internal Trade Secretary Roberto Feletti spoke with IMF staff on Friday about the latest phase of the government's price control programme, according to a statement. The statement did not say who from the IMF spoke with Guzmán and Feletti. The programme, known as Precios Ciudados, “constitutes an important element in the process of attacking the inflationary phenomenon in Argentina,” Guzmán said, according to the statement. "The opportunity to show IMF staff this type of anchor or anti-inflationary strategy of a basket of 1,321 products that is regulated, which can be reviewed quarterly, constitutes an important advance" in a set of measures to combat inflation, Feletti said, according to the statement. An IMF spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
