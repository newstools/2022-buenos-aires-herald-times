Argentina's President Alberto Fernández said Monday that the International Monetary Fund is trying to impose a new programme in the country. "In its statutes, the Fund says that it is going to analyse the programme proposed by the country, but in reality what it is trying to do once again is impose a programme on us and we do not agree there," Fernández told the local radio station 750 AM. "Everyone knows that Argentina cannot cover that payment," Fernández said when asked about a payment due to the IMF that is due in March. "You have to keep talking and try to find a solution with the Fund," he added.
