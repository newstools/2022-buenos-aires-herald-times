Foreign Minister Santiago Cafiero will travel to Washington DC in the coming days ahead of a high-level meeting next week with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Cafiero, 42, is due to discuss a host of topics with his US counterpart at the meeting, scheduled for January 18, including Argentina’s ongoing talks with the International Monetary Fund, climate change and human rights, sources with knowledge of the trip confirmed to Bloomberg on Monday. While he and Blinken are expected to touch on the country’s US$44-billion debt with the IMF, they will not discuss the technical details of ongoing negotiations over a new financing programme, the source added, with the focus on strengthening the relationship with US President Joe Biden’s government. Beyond the meeting with Blinken, the foreign minister has a "vast" agenda of activities for his trip, government sources told Noticias Argentinas. Cafiero’s trip will take place less than a week after Argentina hosted a summit of the CELAC regional bloc of 33 nations, at which President Alberto Fernández was unanimously elected to hold the pro-tempore presidency for the next year. Opposition lawmakers criticised the government for its desire to lead the bloc, which many see as hostile to the United States. The foreign minister’s visit to the United States is due to take place less than two weeks before President Fernández is scheduled to travel to China for the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics and for a meeting with Chinese Premier Xi Jingping. That trip, which has not yet been confirmed and could be cancelled given the surge in Covid cases in Argentina, could potentially anger Washington, which has decided not to send diplomatic delegates to the event citing human rights concerns. – TIMES/NA
