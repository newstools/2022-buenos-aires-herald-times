Argentina's government has fined Facebook five million pesos (US$48,435.67) for including abusive clauses in the privacy policy terms of messaging service WhatsApp, the Productive Development Ministry said in an emailed statement. The sanction was applied through the National Directorate of Consumer Defence and Consumer Arbitration (DNDC), which considers that in Whatsapp's privacy policy clauses, the company dissociates itself from its obligations by limiting its liability for damages, restricting the consumer's rights and thereby expanding its own, the statement said. The investigation began as a result of a complaint filed against changes to privacy terms announced in January 2021. The company failed to file an appeal within the relevant timeframe. by Silvia Martínez, Bloomberg
