One in four young people aged between 18 and 24 in Argentina do not study or work, according to a new study. The report, carried out by the Observatorio de la Deuda Social Argentina (“Social Debt Observatory”) of the Universidad Católica Argentina (Catholic University of Argentina, UCA), also found that more than half of those of the same ages are “excluded” from the education system in 2021, despite an improvement in general terms. When crunching the numbers, the report’s authors found there has been little change between 2017 and 2021 regarding the number of young people who are studying or are gainfully employed, despite the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, with more than 25 percent of youngsters not engaged in either. Women were disproportionately affected, recording a rate that was 10 percent higher than their male counterparts. However, women were more engaged in education, with 54.6 percent of females aged 18 to 24 enrolled in secondary or tertiary studies or having finished higher education, compared to 42.1 percent of young men. Nevertheless, the UCA observatory concluded that more young people from poorer backgrounds were continuing their education, improving by almost nine points between 2017 and 2021. The report’s authors warned of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, however, observing that the number of “marginal” workers had increased over the four-year period that was analysed. – TIMES/NA
