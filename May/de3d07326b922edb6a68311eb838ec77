Nine out of every ten households in urban conglomerations in Argentina have access to the Internet, a new report has revealed, with two out of every three homes having at least one computer. The National Survey on Access to and Use of Information Technologies, produced by the INDEC national statistics bureau as part of its Permanent Household Survey (EPH), found that while the adoption of connectivity slowed during the coronavirus pandemic, its positive trend continued. At the end of 2019, 17.2 percent of homes in the country's main cities were not online, a figure that dropped to 9.9 percent by the close of the following year. By December 31, 2021, however, the share of households without Internet access had fallen to 9.5 percent. Also, two out of three households in these same cities have a computer installed. Looking regionally, the survey revealed that the highest penetration of the Internet is in Patagonia, where only 7.2 percent of households do not have access to the web. In the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area (AMBA), the figure stands at 8.2 percent, with 96.1 percent of all homes in the federal capital enjoying the ability to go online. Drilling down into cities, only two percent of households in Ushuaia have no connectivity, followed by 2.8 percent in Cómodo Rivadavia and 3.6 percent in Rio Gallegos. Conversely, in Rosario 21 percent of households are not connected, compared to 17.3 percent in Resistencia, Chaco Province. The INDEC report also found that 88 out of every 100 Argentines have a mobile phone and 87 out of every 100 use the Internet through at least one device. Generally, there was an increase in the use of all technologies at a national level, with Internet use up 1.7 percent, computer usage up 1.4 percent and a 0.2 percent rise in the adoption of mobile phones.  – TIMES/NA
