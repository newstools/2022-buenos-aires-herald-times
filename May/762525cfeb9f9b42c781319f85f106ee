With the club embroiled in crisis, businessman and TV mogul Marcelo Tinelli has announced his resignation as president of top-flight side San Lorenzo de Almagro. "I have decided to step down as president," wrote Tinelli in a resignation letter admitting that while he believed he had done his best, his efforts had not come to fruition. El Ciclón have been eliminated from the next round of the Copa de la Liga Profesional de Fútbol(LPF) after finishing 10th out of 14 competitors in Zone 1. The side, whose most famous fan is Pope Francis, was also knocked out of the Copa Argentina earlier this year. Fans are furious with the club's management and protests have been staged to demand the resignation of the entire board of directors. Tinelli, 62, stepped down as head of the LPF earlier this season under pressure, a move that strengthened the position of Claudio Tapía, the president of local football's governing body, the Argentine Football Association (AFA). The TV presenter's greatest success as a member of the San Lorenzo board was winning the Copa Libertadores 2014. He became president in 2019 after winning an election with more than 80 percent of the votes of club members.  – TIMES/AFP
