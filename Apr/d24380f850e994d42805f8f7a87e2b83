The British Embassy in Argentina has launched a new contest giving young women the chance to experience diplomatic work firsthand and join a network of female leaders from various countries. The “Ambassador for a Day” programme seeks to promote the inclusion of women in different areas of work and society in general, the Embassy said Tuesday in a press release. The winner(s) will be able to meet and accompany London's envoy in Buenos Aires, Kirsty Hayes, in activities relevant to their chosen area of interest, participate in meetings of the Embassy's working team, join a Latin American network of other competition winners and participate in meetings with British ambassadors in the region, among other opportunities. "I am very pleased to be able to launch a contest like this, which seeks to promote the inclusion and greater participation of women in society,” said Hayes. "We are looking for young women seeking to specialise in topics such as human rights, climate change, economics, or science and innovation. These are all areas relevant to our bilateral relationship and to facing the global challenges that await us in the coming years." More information for applications, due April 29, can be found on the UK Government website. Candidates must be Argentine women pursuing a university degree or who have recently graduated.  – TIMES
