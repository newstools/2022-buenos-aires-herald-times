Argentina's women’s polo team defeated their United States counterparts on Saturday to win the first women’s polo World Cup title at the Campo Argentino de Polo in Buenos Aires. Argentina, led by Milo Fernández Araujo, finished the championship undefeated and emerged as champions after defeating the US 6-2 in an eight-chukker final dominated by the local side. For the Argentine side, 16-year-old Catalina Lavinia was the outstanding player, scoring three goals (one from penalty). Her teammates Agustina Imaz (two goals) and Paulina Vasquetto (one goal) completed the winning team’s tally, with Azucena Uranga as the team's fourth member. The Campo de Polo opened its doors to the public free of charge to attendees by way of promoting the sport. The title decider played out in front of a packed crowd, with supporters enjoying a warm and sunny Autumn afternoon. Argentina had earned its place in the final with a crushing 7- 0 1/2 win over Italy the previous Wednesday. The United States' path to the final was secured by defeating England 4-3. The English women's team eventually finished third with a 6-5 1/2 win over Italy, thanks to a last-minute goal at the end by Heloise Wilson-Smith. The first Women’s Polo World Cup began on April 9, with teams from Argentina, the US, Italy, England, Brazil and Ireland competing. — TIMES/AFP
