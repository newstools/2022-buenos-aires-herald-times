Forbes magazine has released its annual list of richest entrepreneurs in the world, with seven Argentines making the cut. According to the business magazine, the instability of the global markets – primarily a result of the coronavirus pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine – has significantly reduced the number of billionaires on the list this year. Nevertheless, the planet’s richest individuals hold a combined wealth of US$12.7 trillion. Tesla boss Elon Musk, who recently bought into Twitter, was identified as the world’s richest man for the first time. His fortune, which rose to US$219 billion, saw him surpass Amazon's Jeff Bezos with US$171 billion. In Forbes' latest edition, 2,668 individuals globally were identified as billionaires, 87 fewer than the previous year. Seven Argentines, belonging to different categories, were included in the prodigious ranking. They are as follows:  =1) Marcos Galperin – Position 764: US$3.9 billion The richest Argentine is Marcos Galperin, founder and CEO of Mercado Libre. Ranked 764th this year, last year out he was 440th in a select group of the world's 500 richest businessmen, when he had a fortune of USD$6.1 billion. According to Forbes, the CEO of Mercado Libre now has wealth totalling US$3.9 billion.  =1) Paolo Rocca – Position 764: US$3.9 billion In the same position (with an identical size fortune) are the brothers Paolo and Gianfelice Rocca of Grupp Techint. It is worth clarifying that, on the list, the Roccas appear as Italian citizens. Paolo Rocca moved up a few places from last year (807th) as his fortune increased by USD$200 million. However, the brothers remain outside the 500 richest individuals in the world, unlike in 2018 and 2019.  3) Gregorio Pérez Companc – Position 1096: US$2.8 billion In position 1096 is businessman Gregorio Pérez Companc, with a fortune of USD$2.8 billion. Gregorio built the Pérez Companc energy conglomerate and sold it in 2002 to Petrobras for a billion dollars. Pérez Companc rose more than 200 positions in this year's ranking – last year he was 1,299th with US$2.4 billion. The family also has a strong presence in food and telecommunications.  4) Alberto Roemmers – Position 1,292: US$2.4 billion Alberto Roemmers is ranked 1,292nd, with a fortune of around US$2.4 billion.

In the latest incarnation of the rich list, Roemmers has recovered some positions.  5) Alejandro Pedro Bulgheroni – Position 1,579: US$1.9 billion Billionarie Alejandro Bulgheroni, who leads Argentine energy company Bridas Corp, is placed 1,579th. His fortune totals US$1.9 billion, although last year he was ranked 925th.
