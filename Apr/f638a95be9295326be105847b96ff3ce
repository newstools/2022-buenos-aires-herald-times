Argentina's Economy Minister Martín Guzmán said in São Paulo on Friday that Brazil will guarantee the country's energy security in the months of May to September, through the supply of electricity, according to a statement. The official sealed an agreement during a meeting with his counterpart from Brazil's Mining & Energy Ministry Bento Alburquerque. In this way, Argentina will have greater energy resources, which will allow the country to allocate more natural gas to other uses, Guzmán said. The agreement with Brazil, together with an understanding reached with Bolivia in terms of gas supply, will give Argentina "a horizon for this year of much greater certainty in the energy field, and the possibility of providing more predictability regarding the possibility of satisfying demand," added the minister. On the other hand, Guzmán will travel to Brasilia today to meet with his counterpart from the Brazilian Economy Ministry, Paulo Guedes. by Silvia Martínez, Bloomberg
