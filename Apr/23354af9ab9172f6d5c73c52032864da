Mauricio Macri grabbed the attention of social networks on Thursday after revealing that he had met with former US president Donald Trump. According to Macri, the duo discussed bilateral relations between Argentina and the United States and the current state of global affairs. "Today I shared lunch with Donald Trump, where we exchanged views on the global context, the link between Argentina and the United States and everything that our countries can continue to build together," said the PRO leader, who posted a picture of the two leaders smiling on Twitter after sharing lunch. Smiling and in good spirits, the Republican leader is pictured wearing his famous red baseball cap with the caption reading: "Make America Great Again." The meeting, which took place at Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Florida, was also attended by former US ambassador to the Organisation of American States, Carlos Trujillo. Both leaders knew each other before taking office as heads of state, with their paths having crossed in the business world. Diplomatic sources say the two share a good relationship and Trump was a firm backer of Macri's administration in Argentina while in office, supporting the nation's bid for a credit-line with the International Monetary Fund in 2018. The multilateral lender eventually signed a deal worth US$50 billion with Macri's government, which three months later rose to US$57 billion. Earlier this year, Argentina's current government – led by President Alberto Fernández – restructured the country's oustanding US$44.5-billion debt into a new financing programme.  – TIMES
