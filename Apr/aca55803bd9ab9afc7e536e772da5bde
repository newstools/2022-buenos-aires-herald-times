Argentina on Sunday reported its first day without Covid-19 fatalities since the start of the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020. No person was listed as dead in the latest official health report, released Sunday night, though the Health Ministry did confirm 428 new infections in the last 24 hours, bringing the overall number of infected people to 9,060,923 in just over two years. The death toll remained at 128,344, the same figure as in Saturday night’s report. Sunday’s data formed part of the government's first new weekly report, issued as a result of a new modality established by the Health Ministry, which replaces the daily reports on the evolution of the pandemic in the country. The weekly report data indicated that 8,387 new cases of coronavirus and 146 deaths due to the pandemic had been registered during the last seven days. Those hospitalised for Covid-19 in intensive care units totalled 412 across the country, one of the lowest levels since Covid-19 arrived in Argentina. The total number of coronavirus vaccines administered now stands at 97,644,273, according to the Health Ministry, with 82 percent of the population immunised with the full two-dose schedule. Of those, 43 percent have received a third booster jab. Earlier this week, Health Minister Carla Vizzotti said that the government would soon offer a fourth dose to at-risk groups. Starting this Monday, the Health Ministry will also initiate a new surveillance strategy for other respiratory diseases. It will focus on the testing of members of vulnerable groups with respiratory problems: those over 50 years of age, teachers, military, members of prison populations or health facilities, those with health risk conditions and those who have been in a country or region with circulation of a Covid-19 variant of interest or concern for a period of 14 days. — TIMES/AFP/NA
