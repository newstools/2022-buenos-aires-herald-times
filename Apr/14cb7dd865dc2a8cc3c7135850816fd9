The Chilean government has announced the re-opening of all of the country’s land borders that were closed as a preventative measure during the coronavirus pandemic. “The Interior and Public Security Ministry, alongside the Foreign Affairs Ministry and Health Ministry of the Republic of Chile, confirm the opening of the entirety of the land border crossings as of May 1, 2022,” confirmed the government in a post on Twitter. In a press release, Chile said that on Tuesday, April 12, “specific measures from a health point of view” that will be implemented for safe border crossing will be announced. The border closures were put in place on March 17, 2020, after the first Covid-19 cases in the country were registered. With the control of the pandemic and the vaccination process, Chile conducted a gradual reopening. The air border was opened in November 2021 via Santiago Airport, and flights were subsequently resumed at three more air terminals (Antofagasta and Iquique in the north and Punta Arenas in the south). On December 22, five border crossings with Argentina were opened. With Sunday’s announcement, land connections with Bolivia and with Peru in the north, in the Atacama desert, will again be available. In the last two years these zones have registered a high flow of migrants into Chile, primarily Venezuelan nationals. — TIMES/AFP
