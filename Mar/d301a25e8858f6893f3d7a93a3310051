"Costs in Argentina to make hydrogen from natural gas with CO2 capture are already competitive," hydrogen industry group H2ar said in a report distributed by state energy firm YPF this week Producing hydrogen from natural gas with CO2 capture can cost between US$1.40 and US$1.80/kg today, given natural gas prices in Argentina of US$3-US$5/MMBtu. Green hydrogen, made from electrolysis of water with renewable energy, is expected to reach "economic parity" by 2030, which means a cost of US$1.50-US$1.60/kg. Companies in the H2ar group come from various sectors, including power generation, oil and gas production and services, and agricultural trading. by Jonathan Gilbert, Bloomberg
