Argentine actor Enrique Pinti, who rose to fame as a comedian delivering sharp monologues about the idiosyncrasies of his fellow countrymen before embarking on an extensive career in film, theatre and television, died Sunday at the age of 82. Pinti, whose death was confirmed by his relatives, was hospitalised at the beginning of March at a clinic in the capital due to problems related to his diabetes, which had worsened over the past year. However, the actor was planning to return to the stage with a show at a theatre in Avenida Corrientes in Buenos Aires, where he was laid to rest on Monday. "We chose to say goodbye to Enrique Pinti – an enormous reference of this theatrical house – remembering his last marquee. Finally his health did not allow him to carry out the pre-announced show," wrote Carlos Rottemberg, a theatre producer and friend of the actor, on Twitter. Rottemberg described Pinti's death as "one of the saddest moments in the history of Argentine theatre." The actor's famous play Salsa criolla, which premiered in 1985, broke box office records for a decade, becoming a classic of the Buenos Aires theatrical scene. It was characterised by its acidic humour, poking fun at society and Argentine politics. A forerunner of the local stand-up scene, Pinti promoted, produced and directed dozens of so-called "café-concert" shows, where he mixed humour, music, dance and his classic monologues. A professor of literature and Latin, he also led the way with adaptations of foreign plays for local audiences, including Chicago. He also edited a dozen books in which he described the peculiarities of Argentine life. With an extensive career in film and television, Pinti worked on more than 20 films, along with countless roles in television specials, where he also often stood out as a host and scriptwriter. Garlanded with several awards, he won two Platinum Konex awards in 1991 and 2001.  – TIMES/AFP
