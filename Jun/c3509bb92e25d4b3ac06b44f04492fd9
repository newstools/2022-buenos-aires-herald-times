The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund has approved the first quarterly review of Argentina's US$44.5-billion debt programme, paving the way for a new disbursement of US$4.1 billion in funds to strengthen Central Bank reserves. The approval, granted Friday at a board meeting, means the IMF's directors have signed off the targets agreed for the first quarter of the year, which had already been approved by the technical staff overseeing Argentina's Extended Fund Facility programme, headed by Julie Kozack, deputy director of the Western Hemisphere Department, and Luis Cubeddu, mission chief for Argentina. "All quantitative programme targets for the first quarter of 2022 were met," reads the official report, which was submitted to the board on June 8. In that document, the staff opened the door to adding flexibility to the intermediate targets of the programme, while maintaining existing annual targets.  – TIMES/NA
