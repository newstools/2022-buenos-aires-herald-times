More than two years on since their introduction, the use of face masks is no longer compulsory in enclosed places in Buenos Aires, City Hall announced this week. The measure came into effect on Thursday morning after its publication in the Official Gazette of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. City Health Minister Fernán Quirós spoke at a press conference a few hours afterwards to confirm the news. However, local authorities will still recommend the use of a face mask "when entering and remaining in enclosed places of public or private access." The decision comes hand-in-hand with the recent drop in Covid-19 infections, in addition to further adances in the national government’s vaccination campaign. In Buenos Aires City, appointments are now being offered for a fourth dose of coronavirus vaccine, which means that most cases are not serious. In October last year, the use of face masks was no longer compulsory in open air in the capital. Since the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020, facemasks have been a regular reminder of the Covid crisis and one of the main tools in preventing infection.  – TIMES/NA
