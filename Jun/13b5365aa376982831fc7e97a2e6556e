A Uruguayan tourist has died and three other individuals have been injured after a mudslide hit a hotel in the city of San Carlos de Bariloche, in the southern Province of Rio Negro. The incident occurred on Monday afternoon when an embankment gave way due to the rains and caused a mudslide over the Villa Huinid hotel complex located on a ravine next to the Nahuel Huapi lake in the famous tourist town, sources from the local prosecutor's office confirmed. The dead tourist was trapped in one of the building's lower rooms after a day of incessant rain in Bariloche, some 1,500 kilometres south of the capital. The mudslide knocked down a retaining wall, swept away branches and earth, and burst through the back of the resort, which has two buildings, a spa and several cabins that were evacuated, according to reports. At least three injured people had to be taken to the local hospital where they are hospitalised "in stable condition," according to a report by the Río Negro Public Prosecutor's Office. The avalanche also affected a neighbouring hotel, but without causing casualties, according to local media. Firefighters carried out a search with dogs, but no other people were reported to have been affected by the incident, the authorities said. – TIMES/AFP
