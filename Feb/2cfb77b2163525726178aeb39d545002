Argentina's government issued a decree on Tuesday authorising more local debt issuance this year based on the 2021 budget, which was extended to 2022 after rejection in the lower house. The decree authorises Argentina's Treasury to issue an additional 789.6 billion pesos (US$7.4 billion) in notes in 2022, based on the 2021 budget. The decree also approves additional short-term debt issuance of 250 billion pesos for the Economy Ministry and 180 billion pesos for the social security office ANSES. In addition, the government is authorised to import an additional one million cubic metres of diesel and diesel oil. The government's budget proposal for 2022 was rejected by the Congress in December, forcing the extension of the previous year's.  – TIMES/BLOOMBERG
