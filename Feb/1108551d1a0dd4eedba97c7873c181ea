Premier League club Leeds United have decided to "part company" with legendary Argentine coach Marcelo Bielsa following a dreadful run that left them just three points above the relegation zone. "Leeds United can today confirm the club have parted company with head coach Marcelo Bielsa," read a club statement. Bielsa succeeded where many previous managers failed in restoring Leeds to the Premier League two seasons ago. "This has been the toughest decision I have had to make during my tenure at Leeds United, taking into account all the success Marcelo has had at the club," said club chairman  Andrea Radrizzani. The mercurial Argentine's three-year stay at Leeds was already the longest of his club management career. He led the club back into the Premier League after a 16-year absence in 2020 and finished ninth in the first season of their return to the top-flight.  – TIMES/AFP
