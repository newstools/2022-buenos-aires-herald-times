President Alberto Fernández on Thursday evening called on Russia to "put an end to the actions undertaken” in Ukraine “and for all parties involved to return to the dialogue table," in his first comments since President Vladimir Putin ordered his nation’s Armed Forces to invade. "We call on all parties not to use military force," Fernández said in a post on his Twitter account, which arrived hours after most world leaders had commented on events in Eastern Europe. "I deeply regret the escalation of war that we are aware of as a result of the situation generated in Ukraine,” said the president, who did not refer to Putin specifically by name. "Dialogue and respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity, the security of states and human rights guarantee just and lasting solutions to conflicts," added the Frente de Todos leader. "We call on all parties not to use military force. We call on the Russian Federation to stop the actions taken and for all parties involved to return to the dialogue table,” he said. "We remain attentive to the evolution of events and in this context we provided full assistance to Argentinian residents or passengers in Ukraine," he concluded.  – TIMES/TELAM
