The President of the United States is being treated for coronavirus, the press secretary stated this morning. Biden is now isolating, meaning Alberto Fernández’s anticipated meeting with the US leader may no longer take place. The White House statement assured that Biden is “fully vaccinated and twice boosted and experiencing very mild symptoms.” The president has been given the medication Paxlovid. In accordance with the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines, he is in isolation, and will carry out today’s duties over the phone and on Zoom. Depending on the speed of the 79 year-old leader’s recovery, Alberto Fernández’s late-July meeting with him may be virtual. The president will stay in quarantine until he tests negative. The Argentine president is currently in Paraguay, attending the Mercosur South American trade block summit. His meeting with Biden was planned at the beginning of June, following a phone conversation with the US presidency. Alberto was expected to visit on the 26 July, accompanied by the new Economy Minister Silvina Batakis, Foreign Minister Santiago Cafiero, Secretary of Strategic Affairs Gustavo Béliz, and Ambassador to the United States Jorge Argüello. Both the US Embassy in Argentina and Casa Rosada are awaiting an official White House statement on the president’s health, in order to see if Fernández’s meeting with the US president will take place.
