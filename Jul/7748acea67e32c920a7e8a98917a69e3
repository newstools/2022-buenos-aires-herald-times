President Alberto Fernández tapped Silvina Batakis as the country’s new economy minister Sunday after her predecessor resigned Saturday, deepening a political crisis boiling over into the economy and markets. Fernández's spokeswoman Gabriela Cerruti confirmed the decision to Bloomberg News. Batakis inherits a long list of economic challenges and the government’s US$44-billion programme with the International Monetary Fund. The announcement capped more than a day of suspense and uncertainty sparked by Martín Guzmán’s resignation following two and half years in the top economic job. Batakis was the economy minister of Buenos Aires Province from 2011 to 2015 under then-provincial governor Daniel Scioli, who recently became production minister. The appointment was made after Fernández met for hours Sunday with Lower House Speaker Sergio Massa. Vice-President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, who is publicly critical of the president and his economic team, spoke to him Sunday evening by telephone, local media reported. Crisis-prone Argentina is currently battling inflation at over 60 percent, with nearly 40 percent of the population living in poverty and the economy forecast to enter a recession this year. The Central Bank has razor thin cash reserves that it’s struggling to build up amid low credibility and high prices on energy imports and the country’s bonds trade in distressed territory. Markets will be watching for clues on Batakis’ economic agenda, the IMF programme and how she plans to navigate a divided ruling coalition that ended Guzmán’s tenure. by Patrick Gillespie, Bloomberg
