An 18-year-old football fan has died from gunshot wounds sustained in an attack by barra brava football hooligans at a fourth-tier match in the city of Luján, Buenos Aires Province. Youngster Joaquín Coronel died Monday after being hit by gunshots fired by fans from rival team Club Leandro N. Alem (Club Deportivo y Mutual Leandro N. Alem) at Club Luján's stadium after the two sides faced each other in a Primera C clásico the previous day. The death in Luján, which lies around 60 kilometres west of the capital Buenos Aires, came after the game had been suspended in the 14th minute after violent incidents. The game was level at 0-0 at the time. Coronel's killing is the 342nd death related to football matches in Argentina since 1922. Two-thirds of the deaths have occurred from the 1990s onwards, according to local NGO Salvemos al Fútbol. According to reports in local media, Coronel and six others were hospitalised with gunshot wounds after barra bravas from Club Deportivo y Mutual Leandro N. Alem shot at them from a car in a drive-by attack outside the stadium. There was no report yet on the state of health of the others who were injured. The Argentine Football Association (AFA) issued a statement in which it "regrets and strongly condemns the acts of violence outside the Municipal Stadium of Luján and is committed to collaborating "with the judicial investigation."
